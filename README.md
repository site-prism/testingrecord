## History

This in a new gem I've made to facilitate testing on websites where you want to track all data being created

This gem was made to try solve the problem where I had been caching models each time at new jobs,
hopefully some of the stuff here will be useful

The gem is currently version unstable

## Usage

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add testingrecord

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install testingrecord

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests
